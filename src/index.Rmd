## Class overview

This course focuses on micro-econometric methods that have applications to a wide range of economic questions. We study identification, estimation, and inference in both parametric and non-parametric models and consider aspects such as consistency, bias and variance of estimators. We discuss how repeated measurements can help with problems related to unobserved heterogeneity and measurement error, and how they can be applied to panel and network data. Topics include duration models, regressions with a large number of covariates, non-parametric regressions, and dynamic discrete choice models. Applications include labor questions such as labor supply, wage inequality decompositions and matching between workers and firms.  Students will be expected to solve programming assignment in R.

## Getting started with R {#start}

You will first need to install `R` and `Rstudio`. To do use the following links:

 - [R](https://cran.rstudio.com/)
 - [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

Here is a [tutorial](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/data.table/vignettes/datatable-intro.pdf) and a [cheatsheet](https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/img/blog/data+table+cheat+sheet.pdf) for `data.table`

Here is a [tutorial](http://www.ceb-institute.org/bbs/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/handout_ggplot2.pdf), a [cheatsheet](http://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/ggplot2-cheatsheet-2.0.pdf) and the [full documentation](http://docs.ggplot2.org/current/) for `ggplot2`.

You can install most packages directly:

```r
install.packages(c("devtools","data.table","ggplot2","plyr"))
```
