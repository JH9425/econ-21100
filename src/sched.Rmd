## Homeworks

You can submit your homework either as solo or as a group of two. To submit your homework, create a channel in our slack group with a name starting with `grp_` and then with the initials of the members of your group. For instance the professor and myself would be `grp_tw`. Then please add the professor and myself as members of that group. You can make your group private if you don't want other students to see your homework.

 - [Hw1](hw-probability.html) on probabilities and central limit theorem is due Wednesday Octover 11th before midnight
 - Hw2 on inference
 - Hw3 on Maximum likelihood
 - TBD

## End of class project

 - 1 page proposal is due end of week 6.
