## Homeworks

You can submit your homework either as solo or as a group of two. To communicate about your homework, create a channel in our slack group with a name starting with `grp_` and then with the initials of the members of your group. For instance the TA (Arjun) and myself (Thibaut) would be `grp_at`. Then please add Arjun and myself as members of that group. You can make your group private if you don't want other students to see your homework. Submit the analytical parts directly to this slack group.

<!-- To submit your answers to computational homeworks. Please create a `git` repository (you can make it private), and add the RA and myself as contributor (in the case of private), or just share the URL with us if you choose to make the repo public. You can create your repository on [github](http://github.com) or [bitbucket](htpp://bitbucket.org), your choice! -->

 - <span class="label label-warning">new</span> [Homework 1](pdf/hw1_f19.pdf) (analytical) due date is Tuesday Oct 15th .

## End of class project

 - The project can be done in groups of three. The goal is for you to take an economic or policy question and to develop a DGP for that question as well as a method adpated to answering that question given data. The project should highlight the potential pitfalls of given methods. 
 - 1 page proposal is due on week 8, Thrudsay nov 21st. This should include a question and a DGP.
 - finall submission of the project will be after finals.

## Midterm

 - The <span class="label label-warning">midterm</span> will in week 7, on Thursday November 14th.
 - I will be away during week 4 (Oct 22nd and 24th).

## Grading scheme

Overall grade will be 1/3 homeworks, 1/3 midterm, 1/3 project.
