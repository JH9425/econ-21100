## Homeworks

You can submit your homework either as solo or as a group of two. To communicate about your homework, create a channel in our slack group with a name starting with `grp_` and then with the initials of the members of your group. For instance the TA (Arjun) and myself (Thibaut) would be `grp_at`. Then please add Arjun and myself as members of that group. You can make your group private if you don't want other students to see your homework. Submit the analytical parts directly to this slack group.

<!-- To submit your answers to computational homeworks. Please create a `git` repository (you can make it private), and add the RA and myself as contributor (in the case of private), or just share the URL with us if you choose to make the repo public. You can create your repository on [github](http://github.com) or [bitbucket](htpp://bitbucket.org), your choice! -->

 - [Homework 1](pdf/hw1_w18.pdf) (analytical) is due Monday, January the 22nd, Midnight. 
 - [Homework 2](hw-lsupply.html) (computer) is due Wednesday, January the 31nd, Midnight.
 - [Homework 3](hw-inference.html) (computer) is due Wednesday, February 7th, Midnight.
 - [Homework 4](pdf/hw4_w18.pdf) (analytical) is due Thursday, Ferbruary 16th. 
 - [Homework 5](hw-hetero.html) (computer) is due Friday, March 9th, Midnight.
 
## End of class project

 - The project can be done in group of three. The goal is for you to take an economic or policy question and to develop a DGP for that question as well as a method adpated to answering that question given data. The project should show the potential pitfalls of given methods.
 - 1 page proposal is due end of week 7, this should include the DGP.

## Midterm

 - The <span class="label label-warning">midterm</span> will in week 8, on Thursday February 22nd.
 - I will be away during week 8.
