We consider here discrete choices over a set of alernatives. The utility of the agent is modeled as 

# Cake eating

Imagine you a given a cake os size $S$, and you need to decide how much to eat everyday. How would you formulate the problem?

$$   \max_{c_t}  \sum_{t=0}^\infty \beta^t u( c_t) \quad s.t. \quad \sum_{t=0}^\infty c_t \leq S$$
One can write the Lagrangian of this problem and find:

$$L = \sum_{t=0}^\infty \beta^t u( c_t) - \lambda \Big(  \sum_{t=0}^\infty c_t - S \Big)$$

and when the error term is type 2 extreme value. This gives the following FOCs:

$$ \beta^t u'(c_t) = \lambda  $$

Consider a CRRA utility function $u(c)=\frac{c^{1-\gamma}}{1-\gamma}$ which gives $ u'(c)=c^{-\gamma}$ and hence
$$ \sum_{t=0}^\infty c_t = \sum_{t=0}^\infty \Big( \frac{\lambda}{\beta^t} \Big)^{-\frac{1}{\gamma} } = \frac{\lambda^{-\frac{1}{\gamma}}}{1-\beta^{1/\gamma-1}} =S $$
hence we get that the consumption will be 

$$c_t = \Big( \frac{\lambda}{\beta^t} \Big)^{-\frac{1}{\gamma} } = (1-\beta^{1/\gamma-1})\beta^{t/\gamma}S$$

We can easily plot this for different values of $\beta$ and $\gamma$

## A recursive formulation

Let's introduce $V(S)$ as the present value, the life time value of having a cake of size $S$ today and consuming optimally in the future.

$$V(S) = \max_{c_t}  \sum_{t=0}^\infty \beta^t u( c_t) \quad s.t. \quad \sum_{t=0}^\infty c_t \leq S$$
But note that 

$$V(S) = \max_{c}  u(c) + \beta V(S-c) $$

# The bus engine problem

Imagine that we want to model the decision to replace the engine on in a fleet of buses. 

 - the state is $x_t$, the mileage of the bus
 - every period, the bus delivers profit as a function of $x_t$, call it $p(x_t)$
 - the bus owner Mr Zurcher, can decide to replace the engine at cost $C$ in which case $x_t$ goes back to $0$
 - the bus dies with probability a function of $x_t$ in which case the owner gets $0$
 - the owner discounts at rate $\beta$

Using our Bellman tool we can write the optimal decision for this problem recursively:

$$ V(x) = \max \{ p(x) + \lambda(x)\beta V(x+u) , -C + \beta V(0) \} $$
We can see that this will have a threshold property. In practice the decision won't be as clear as a simple threshold. We want to allow for some randomness. We then add a logit preference shock $\xi$ to the different between the two options. We then remember that we can transform the max into a log-sum-exp.

$$ V(x) = \log\Big( \exp \Big[p(x) + \lambda(x)\beta V(x+u)\Big] + \exp \Big[ -C + \beta V(0) \Big] \Big) + \gamma $$

There is not hope to solve this problem in closed form. We tackle it numerically.
