This is a tutorial for Git. We focus on the features necessary for homework submission.


# What is Git?

- It is a **version control** system.
- A cloud storage that is specialized for developing and maintaining source codes.
- Especially useful when developing the codes as a team.

# For the homework submission...

- You may use git as another Dropbox or Google Drive
- which means you do everything in a traditional way and then just use git to upload the final version.
- That is fine for the class.
- Of course you can try using features of git.
- For example, if you do the homework as a pair, you may use git to collaborate.

# Git workflow (example)

1. Create the remote (i.e. cloud) storage and **clone** it with the local storage in your computer.

2. Make changes in the local storage and then **push** the changes to the remote storage.

3. In other machines, **pull** any changes from the remote storage to update the local storage.

  + Then make further changes in the local storage, and then **push** the changes to the remote storage.


# Commit and push

- In Step 2 of the above, git requires to **commit** the changes before we **push** the changes to the remote storage.
- **commit** is a procedure that records the history of the source code
- Git records history of all the changes that are made for the source code, like below:

- To update the remote storage, you first **commit** to record these changes and then **push**.
- When you **commit**, you can add comments to describe the changes made.


# Branch

- When developing the code, we may want to try various revisions from the current version.
- Git is able to track multiple lines of histories originating from one node, which we call **branches**.
- It is useful when someone wants to develop the code differently from the mainstream branch, the **master** branch.

- **Branching** also happens when multiple members try to update the same file at the same time.
- Git assigns members to different branches to resolve the updating problem.
- If the team wants to apply the changes in a branch into the **master** branch, they can **merge** the branch.

- For simple tasks like writing the homework, you would simply use the **master** branch.



# Using Git

- In principle, Git uses console commands.
- That means we type something like the following 
to do the tasks described in the workflow: 
```{r, eval=FALSE}
git commit -m "first draft of HW1"
git push origin master
```

- If you dislike this, you can use GUI applications that helps you to do these by clicking buttons.
- I personally use Sourcetree, which is free, but of course you can use other applications.
- As long as you understand the concept of **commit**, **push**, **pull**, etc., you would have no problem using these GUI applications.

- To use git, you need accounts from Github or Bitbucket. Create an account.
- Even with GUI applications, creating a remote storage may require you to specify things that you have no idea. In that case, go to the website of Github or Bitbucket and create a remote storage in the website.
- Then you would have no problem **cloning** the remote storage into your computer using the GUI applications.
- Once you **clone** the storage, you can now **commit**, **push** and **pull** the changes.
